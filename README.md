# Object-Oriented-Hotel-Management-System

‣ **Harnessing OOP Principles**: Created a comprehensive Hotel Management System by applying key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism to address real-world challenges in the competitive hotel industry

‣ **Streamlining Hotel Operations:** Developed a Java-based solution using OOP methodologies, efficiently managing vast amounts of data, automating processes, and providing real-time insights into hotel operations. This project not only demonstrates OOP expertise but also highlights the practical application of OOP principles to optimize operational efficiency.

#Methodology
‣ Utilize VsCode to create a new Java project and add the necessary libraries: Create a new Java project in NetBeans and add the required libraries for JDBC and rs2xml.jar to
connect to the database and retrieve data to display in the user interface.
‣ Design an efficient database to store relevant information: Determine the entities required to build a Hotel Management System and design a database schema that
meets the requirements, then create the necessary tables for each entity.
‣ Use Java JDBC to interact with the database: Use the Java JDBC API to connect to the database, execute SQL queries, and retrieve data to display in the user interface.
‣ Build a user interface using Java Swing: Design an intuitive user interface using Java Swing components that allows users to interact with the system and perform
necessary actions such as adding new customer information or making room reservations.
